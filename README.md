# MVP Starter App

An entire app starter base that includes frontend and backend functions including users, sign in and registration. A simple starter point to get an MVP up and running.

As someone with a lot of product ideas, I found myself bootstrapping the same things over and over again. I created this repo for myself to save me countless hours re-coding the same functionality over and over again. This repo is perfect for MVP products, as its quick and easy to build upon and its not wrapped in a million different frameworks.

## Backend
Express & mongoose

Easy and efficient way to boostrap a backend for your app. Everything is JSON, for a front-end developer thats basically gold. 

**Begin Developing**
Simply run `npm run dev` inside of the `src/backend` folder to start up your backend service. Dev will start an express server at port 3001.


## Frontend
React app

Simple react app, no other dependencies others than bcrypt, axios, react router

**Begin Developing**
Simply run `npm run start` insode of the `src/frontend` folder to start your front-end application. Upon running the application you will see a home page and login page already setup and ready to go!
