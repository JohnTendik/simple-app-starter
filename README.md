# mvp-app-starter

An entire app starter base that includes frontend and backend functions including users, sign in and registration. A simple starter point to get an MVP up and running.

As someone with a lot of product ideas, I found myself bootstrapping the same things over and over again. I created this repo for myself to save me countless hours re-coding the same functionality over and over again. This repo is perfect for MVP products, as its quick and easy to build upon and its not wrapped in a million different frameworks.

#### Backend
Express & mongoose

Easy and efficient way to boostrap a backend for your app. Everything is JSON, for a front-end developer thats basically gold. 


#### Frontend
React app

Simple react app, no other dependencies others than bcrypt.
